  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>
    I wanted to understand how data could be transformed into predictions using
    real algorithms instead of just theory.

  <h2>My Approach</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Collected and cleaned the dataset</li>
    <li>Performed basic exploratory data analysis</li>
    <li>Trained a simple regression model</li>
    <li>Evaluated performance using accuracy metrics</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>
    I learned that machine learning is not just about algorithms but also about
    data quality, feature selection, and continuous experimentation.
